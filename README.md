## Getting Started

This project is a part of my thesis subject.
This website has been developed using modern JavaScript Frameworks such as React and Next.js. 

This is part of the three small projects, which will be developed using 3 different rendering methods.
As React in the nature using client-side rendering, other part of the project will be developed using the Server Side Rendering and Static Site Generation.

Next.js a React framework makes it possible to do that.
Other than that and most importantly the energy source plays an immense role. 
Where data are being stored and web hosting technology will determine if the product can achieve a sustainable product.

## Goal
Less is more.
Sustainability in Software Development.
The goal of this project is to find out if there is an effect of developing a website using Frameworks and web optimization on sustainability by measuring the amount 
of Carbon Footprints by a single visit to the website.  
Finding out the best practice or the considerations to be observed to develop a website in terms of sustainability.

## The Website
The website provides over 500 data of pokemon characters with images and its attributes. 
With lazy-loading image approach and Next.js `<Image>` Component or choosing image format such as webp, 
the amount of the data transferred could be reduced drastically.

## The Output.
In order to challenge the hypothesis, Ecograder was used to measure the amount of the CO2 emits. 
Compared to the same website that uses the conventional approach during its development, the website using a modern Framework and Weboptimization emits 20x less CO2.
